This is made specifically for Xbox Consoles and hopefully will give users enough customisation options to make it feel their own. 
## Usage
[Check out our Wiki for setup and usage intructions](https://github.com/Misunderstood-Wookiee/LaunchPass/wiki)


## Limitations

 - Xbox Only
 - Optimized for Gamepad Only
 - Zipped content supported only if RetroArch, Retrix Gold or other supported cores/emulators support compressed archive format.
 - No Automatic Scrapper, you must use [LaunchBox](https://www.launchbox-app.com). for Setup (More Info Below)
 - EmulationStation support is discontinued sorry!
 - Video Background can cause lag in some-instances due to UWP limitations, we recommend 1080p resolutions and use a Image for the Game Details to reduce how many video play at the same time. (Series X may fair better in this regard)
